# Playground Todo

- [ ] streamline colors plugin example and plugin studio to just have colors as the default plugin
- [ ] better yet, put an edit button in the plugin manager list and send the plugin details to plugin studio

## Files

add onkeydown.stopPropagation to input and CodeEditor oninput callbacks
clean up plugin manager (and probably selectoplasm and playground)
convert colors plugin to the default values for Plugin Studio

would be nice to destroy open stylesheet windows if the stylesheet goes away
