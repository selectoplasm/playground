# Playground Todo

- [ ] get `ComponentLibrary` download button working (might as well install `@selectoplasm/utils` at this point)
- [ ] add BroadcastChannel API instructions (maybe create multiple pages?)

## Files

add onkeydown.stopPropagation to input and CodeEditor oninput callbacks
clean up plugin manager (and probably selectoplasm and playground)
convert colors plugin to the default values for Plugin Studio

would be nice to destroy open stylesheet windows if the stylesheet goes away
