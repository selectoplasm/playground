## worker.js

Once you have a state object generated by your config.html, Selectoplasm will pass this object to your web worker. On the playground, the web worker boilerplate is handled for you, so you can just destructure your state from the config object, like this:

```js
// your property names are the names of your inputs in config.html
const { hue, saturation, lightness } = config

// the playground provides a helper function to create rulesets
const root = ruleset(":root" [
   ["--color", `hsl(${hue}, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%);`]
])

// if you don't want to use the helper function,
// this is the format you need to create a ruleset
const root = {
   selector: ":root",
   declarations: [
      ["--color", `hsl(${hue}, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%);`]
   ]
}

// return all your created rulesets in an array
return {
   rulesets: [ root ]
}
```
